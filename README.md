This project taught me how to:

Retrieve data from tables using SELECT statement,
Examine the structure of tables (column names, primary keys),
Join tables using LEFT JOIN and INNER JOIN,
Stack data from multiple tables,
Perform aggregate functions (average, count),
Filter data using WHERE clause,
Sort data using ORDER BY clause,
Use CASE statements.
